# Claude Web — working plan

> Editing any plan? First read
> [doc principles](plans/doc-principles.md) — cohesion by unit,
> progressive disclosure, reference-don't-duplicate.
>
> New doc-viewer capabilities, shown live:
> [doc-viewer examples](plans/doc-viewer-examples.md) — open it in the
> Files tab to see wrapping mermaid labels etc. in action.

> **Status (2026-06-13):** No feature in flight.

## Active feature plans

- [Docs viewer](plans/doc-viewer.md) — sliced: 1) mermaid label wrapping
  (deployed & confirmed 2026-06-12), 2) doc links + history in the Files
  viewer (deployed & confirmed 2026-06-12, merged to main), 3) cross-repo
  links + 4) HTML webview (deferred).
- [Settings tab](plans/settings-tab.md) — rearrangeable nav-tab order with
  live preview; extracts the one canonical tab registry (planned,
  `feature/settings-tab`).

## Recently shipped

- [Projects folder picker](plans/projects-folder-picker.md) — navigable
  folder picker replaces the chip wall; folder creation is explicit only
  (typos no longer create folders). Merged to main, deployed & confirmed
  2026-06-13.
- [Multi-pane: five panes](plans/multi-pane-five.md) — desktop pane cap
  raised 4 -> 5 for 4K monitors. Merged to main, deployed 2026-06-13.
- [IP intelligence](plans/ip-intel.md) — country/ISP/datacenter enrichment
  in the Guests tab. Deployed & confirmed 2026-06-12.
- **Git tab suite** (merged to main 2026-06-12 evening, deployed & confirmed):
  [origin visibility](plans/git-origin-visibility.md) (honest origin/main
  comparisons + drift warning), [actions](plans/git-actions.md)
  (merge-main/pull-main/pull-branch/push-branch with busy-guard and
  conflict auto-abort), [other-branches overview](plans/git-branches.md)
  (cross-computer WIP memory, dead branches hidden) and the
  [history graph](plans/git-graph.md) (mermaid, newest at top, HEAD
  marked). Also enforced: deploys must contain origin/main
  (docs/claude-web/self-dev.md + swap.ps1 guard).
- [Auth IP filter](plans/auth-ip-filter.md) — IP allowlist gate in front of
  password login. Merged to main, deployed & field-tested 2026-06-12.
- [Terminal sessions](plans/terminal-sessions.md) — Chat/Term in one nav
  slot, multiple PTYs, interactive `claude --resume`. Deployed & confirmed
  2026-06-12 (includes the deploy-tooling post-mortem).
- [Files tree view](plans/files-tree-view.md) — VS Code-style folder
  expand/collapse in the Files tab. Merged to main, deployed.
- [Terminal tab](plans/terminal-tab.md) — the ConPTY foundation the
  sessions feature builds on (PR #7).

## Next up

- Housekeeping (offered, awaiting the user's word): delete the merged local
  branches (4× feature/git-* + 17 older ones — the Git tab's dead-branch
  filter already hides them).
