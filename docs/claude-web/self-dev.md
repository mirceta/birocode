<!-- managed by Claude Web -- re-run "Prepare for preview" to update -->

# This repo is Claude Web itself (self-development)

You cannot build into the running app's own `bin/` (its `ClaudeWeb.exe` is locked)
or reuse its port. Build to an isolated dir and run on 5200:

```powershell
npm --prefix client install
npm --prefix client run build
dotnet build ClaudeWeb.App/ClaudeWeb.App.csproj -o .claudeweb-preview/bin
Copy-Item client/dist .claudeweb-preview/bin/client/dist -Recurse -Force
$env:CLAUDEWEB_PORT = "5200"
Start-Process .claudeweb-preview/bin/ClaudeWeb.exe
```

`.claudeweb-preview/` is gitignored. A second monitoring window appearing is
expected.
